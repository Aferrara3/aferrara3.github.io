                        Since I haven't put my life in public in some time, let's set the stage. 2023 was a tumultulous year for lots of reasons. Loss, multiple job changes following a 6 yr stable stint, termination of our roaming lifestyle settling down on a 1 yr lease in SLC.
                    </br></br>
                        So 2024 kicked off with a lot of things in flux. Q1 I spent unemployed and it was kindof awesome. Genuinely one of the best times I have had in a while. The funny thing is that in a way it may also have been one hardest working windows of life - but I loved the freedom of it. Having the energy to pursue passion projects all day instead of only beyond the 9-5 (ideally) bounds is absolutely invigorating.
                    </br></br>
                        Not having any obligations for our first full ski season located in SLC was obviously tight, but the real highlight for me I think was getting a 3D printer and learning all of the new skills that came along with it. I'm not going to go into detail here as I could write pages on it and totally lose ya. Come through some time and I'll gladly give you a tour of all the projects. Naturally this was supplemented with some different software projects and fun little mixes of the 2 where they could intersect for home automation projects and the like. 
                    </br></br>
                        While I am still curretly in full grind mode at my new job and am quite enjoying it, I do thirst for the day that things relax a bit and I can dedicate the time to really productize one of these projects into a more sustainable revenue stream.  
                    </br></br>
                        So despite it hurting my generally anti-corporate spirit, the severance runway eventually ran out, meaning it was time to go back to work. To round off work updates, since April I have been working in a new role that has been pretty sick. Tl;dr I am building solutions on top of the hottest generative AI models. It leans more R&D than product focused, so I get lots of freedom to explore interesting tech stacks and just build cool shit. It has been a great learning opportunity working at an unfamiliar scale, with all of the shiny new tools, and building new skills with more direct project and people leadership. I came in as employee #5 in a brand new team so was able to play a significant role in scaling out the team and steering our ship; and I am grateful for the autonomy that I have been afforded in doing so.
                    </br></br>
                        Alright enough of that, work to live don't live to work.
                    </br></br>
                        This year we expanded our lil family when we adopted Monty, who is the most loving agent of chaos you've ever met. We found Monty at the UT Humane Society because he was adorable and had a great friendly demeanor amongst the puppies there. Little did we know what we were getting ourselves into, as a DNA test has confirmed a blend of 3 high energy working breeds - and it shows. Infinite. Energy.
                    </br></br>
                        I am sure some of you reading this know of the challenges that this has presented... but he has so much potential there it is unreal. I have never interacted with a dog with such raw intelligence. It is a blessing and a curse for sure since he is keenly aware of when you are paying attention vs when it is high time for mischief. I've also never had a dog so affectionate. This little dude lives to please and will velcro himself to you in pursuit of your attention for better and for worse. Also wildly athletic.
                    </br></br>
                        Banksy wasn't always thrilled with having the crazy new guy around and it took some time to learn each others' boundaries and whatnot, but these days they are bros and buds. As I type this driving to GA for the holidays they are cuddled together in the backseat - a level of calmness that Banksy has never exhibited on roadtrips before. 
                    </br></br>
                        Kelsy is doing well! She turned the Big 3-0 this year which we celebrated with a belated trip to Iceland. She has been with the same company for almost 2 years now which brings some stability to our sphere of existence - as much stability as typically comes with a fast-paced high-workload startup environment :D. I don't want to go too deep into her happenings highlights since I believe she is writing her own blog-ish post for this!
                    </br></br>
                        Let's talk the first full year SLC - </br> 
                        After bouncing around so much in previous years, actually planting ourselves in Salt Lake City for a full 12 months has been both challenging and awesome. On the one hand, building a local community out of thin air isn’t as easy as I hoped (“Hi, will you be my friend?” doesn't play as well as it did at 22). On the other hand, the door never stopped swinging open for visiting friends and family. Each time that someone new came through it felt a little more like home, and fortunately our friends travel well, especially to here.
                    </br></br>
                        We didn’t snag quite as many ski days as we’d dreamed—turns out getting a new dog and a new city locked down at the same time is a bit of a juggling act, but we still managed some killer runs here in Utah plus fun side trips to Banff and Bend giving some appreciation for being 'out west' generically as a jumping off point. Once the snow melted, we got to show our families that Utah isn’t just about powder days: the hiking, lakes, and general outdoor goodness in warmer weather had them as stoked as we are.
                    </br></br>
                        All said, Year One of being official Utahns has been a crash course in balancing mountain adventures, new-friend speed dating, and leaning into a semi-settled life. It’s not perfect, but it’s starting to feel like the right kind of home base. If you haven’t made it out here yet, trust me—these mountains know how to roll out the welcome mat.

                        <b>Conclusion</b> 
                        I'm a corporate drone software nerd, so through the lens of this year as a sprint retro since those are the questions I started drafting all of this against:
                    <ul>
                        <li>- What Went Well: Finding a steady footing in SLC, adopting Monty, deepening friendships, and exploring new passions.</li>
                        <li>- Needs Improvement: More consistent 5–9 time. More ski days, never enough.</li>
                        <li>- Keep Doing: Traveling, hosting friends, experimenting with new tech, leaning into new experiences.</li>
                        <li>- Stop Doing: Underestimating what Monty can chew through (spoiler: it’s everything).</li>
                    </ul>
                        Alright, I think I'm done. Thanks to anyone who made it this far
                    </br></br>
Cheers,</br>
Alex
