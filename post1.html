<b>tl;dr Departing GM 5/31 - #OpenToWork !</b>
<br/><br/>
Two of the most common pieces of advice with regards to career development that I have received have been to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Take risks.</li>
<li>Find a new job while you still have your current one.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In a way however, I find these to be quite incongruent. A complete intolerance for unemployment feels about as risk averse as it gets, so a priority between those needed to be struck.
<br/><br/>
I had a mentor of sorts once tell me that they "just wanted to build cool shit" and that has resonated with me quite strongly ever since. As ideas grow and the realities of productization hit, the corporate machine has a way of creating process that tightly control the flow of development. While these are very important for ensuring product safety and quality, they tend to somewhat constrain room for further innovation. The structure of it all pulls the engineering process itself out of the lab and puts it onto an assembly line - for better <i>and</i> for worse. I was fortunate enough to contribute to a project with AV Compute that I do believe will change the world in redefining how we all engage with transit, but at this point the technology and product feels like it is on a glidepath to success and my role in getting there is completed. It is simply time for me to do something else. It is time to find a new exciting problem to tackle and really get excited about something again.
<br/><br/>
And so I have decided to take a leap. I am leaving my current role and employer and am entering the great unknown that is today's labor market. After just shy of 6 years with General Motors, I am incredibly grateful of the experiences I have had and skills that I have gained. I am thankful for some great direct leaders that took risks and afforded me such autonomy to grow in each role along the way. Alas however the time has come to do something new. To chase a passion. To invest my time fully in myself and my ideas and see what might come of it. My decision to leave is in no way a slight to General Motors - this company has a high quality vision truly cornerstoned in ideals of safety and sustainability, as well as some high quality folks to execute on it. I earnestly hope that my career may cross paths with many of these folks again in the future.
<br/>

<h3>So what is next?</h3>

At the end of the day I frankly have no idea where things will go from here. What I do know is that I love solving complex problems. I know that I am excited by the vast landscape of untapped applications for ML and AI beyond Big Tech's current sphere of influence. I am excited about ideas with the potential to revolutionize human interaction with one other and with the world around us. With so much negativity in the zeitgeist today, I hope to find myself in a position where I can move the needle on something that promotes a more utopian vision for the future[1]. I hope to work on something positive with tangible capacity to help others. Do you have a role to fill on your team that fits that bill? <b>Let's chat!</b>
<br/><br/>
Beyond jumping straight into another position on an established project, I would absolutely love to pursue a more entrepreneurial path or join something exciting on the ground floor; and I intend to make that my primary focus during any career gap that develops in this time. On which note...
<br/>Do you have a great idea and are looking for some specific hardware/software technical expertise to get it off of the ground? <b>Let's chat.</b>
<br/>Are you interested in hearing and potentially incubating some exciting early-stage product or service ideas? <b>Let's chat.</b>
<br/>Are you or your team facing any interesting problems that may benefit from an outside perspective and/or skillset to address? <b>Let's chat.</b>
<br/><br/>
The uncertainties that come along with jumping without any safety net stirs a beautiful blend of terror with freeing excitement. I guess that is the foundation of "taking risks" after all. Life is too short for complacency. Hoping it pans out.
<br/><br/>
If you, or anyone in your own network, has any opportunities that you think may be an appropriate fit, please do not hesitate to reach out or share this post. I would love to connect with you.
<br/><br/>
Cheers,</br>
Alex
